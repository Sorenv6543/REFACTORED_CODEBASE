```

## Technology Stack

- Vue 3 with Composition API
- TypeScript
- Pinia for state management
- Vue Router
- Vuetify for UI components
- FullCalendar for calendar functionality
- Firebase for backend/authentication

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Code Conventions

- Use TypeScript for all files
- Follow consistent naming: camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for components
- Use Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Document public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Extract reusable logic into composables
- Use interfaces for data models # REFACTORED_CODEBASE
